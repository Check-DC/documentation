# The CheckDev Guidelines
The purpose of this guide is to define standards and also ensure that code written by developers at Check DC are excellent. These guidelines are to be applied for checkpoint assessments as well as regular day to day code reviews.

As a an Engineer, code review/refactor is one of the most important aspects of what you do and doing it right is instrumental to writing better, highly scalable and extendable code.
